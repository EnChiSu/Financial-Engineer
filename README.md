# Financial-Engineering

This is my Financial Engineering class note in the second semester of 2019 at NTU.

# Personal Information
My name is En-Chi Su (蘇恩祺). You can also call me Oggie(sounds like En-Chi). Currently, I study master's in Business Administration at National Taiwan University. I've five-year experiences using R, and half-year experiences in Python. <br />
<br />
This is the first time I take finance related courses. If there is any suggestion you would like to give, please don't hesitate to contact me through my email r07741074@ntu.edu.tw. Thank you.

# Homework 1:

I present HW1 with three files:
* The first file is "HW1 Learning Lesson.md" which I explain the lesson I learn during this week's HW.
* The second file is "HW1_Work flow.ipynb" which I demonstrate and explain work flow step by step.
* The third file is "HW1_Package code.ipynb" which I package all the code in each step into a function which you can simply execute and it would demonstrate similar results as https://ttc.scu.org.tw/memdca1.htm. <br />

You can also click the link in the table below to read each file.

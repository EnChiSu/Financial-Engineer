# Homework 1:

I present HW1 with three files:
* The first file is "HW1 Learning Lesson.md" which I explain the lesson I learn during this week's HW.
* The second file is "HW1_Work flow.ipynb" which I demonstrate and explain work flow step by step.
* The third file is "HW1_Package code.ipynb" which I package all the code in each step into a function which you can simply execute and would demonstrate similar results as https://ttc.scu.org.tw/memdca1.htm. <br />

You can also click the link in the table below to read each file.

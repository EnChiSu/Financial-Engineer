# Homework 3:

I present HW3 with three files:
* The first file is "HW3 Learning Lesson.md" which I explain the lesson I learn during this week's HW.
* The second file is "HW3_Work flow.ipynb" which I demonstrate and explain my work flow for this week's HW step by step.
* The third file is "HW3_Package code.ipynb" which I package all the code in the work flow file into a function. You can simply download and execute it. <br />

You can also click links in the table below to read each file.

# Homework 2:

I present HW2 with three files:
* The first file is "HW2 Learning Lesson.md" which I explain the lesson I learn during this week's HW.
* The second file is "HW2_Work flow.ipynb" which I demonstrate and explain work flow step by step.
* The third file is "HW2_Package code.ipynb" which I package all the code in the work flow file into a function which you can simply execut. <br />

You can also click the link in the table below to read each file.
